Item.55: Familiarize yourself with Boost


Boost is community of C++ developers and a collection of freely downloadable C++ libraries
http://boost.org


01.
Boost has uniquely close and influential relationship with the C++ standardization committee


02.
Boost acceptance for accepting libraries is based on public peer review


All boost libraries must compile under at least two compilers (to demonstrate portability)
and must attest that the library can be made available under an acceptable licence (free)


Peer review questions:
- How good are the design and implementation?
- Is the code portable across compilers and operating systems?
- Is the library likely to be of use to its target audience, i.e., people working in the domain the library addresses?
- Is the documentation clear, complete, and accurate?


Peer reviews do good job of keeping poorly written libraries out of Boost
Also educate library authors in design + documentation of industrial-strength cross-platform libraries


Boost libraries call into categories:
- String and text processing
- Containers
- Function objects and higher-order programming
- Generic programming
- Template metaprogrammingg (TMP)
- Math and numerics
- Correctness and testing
- Data structures
- Inter-language support
- Memory
- Miscellaneous


REMEMBER
* Boost is a community and web site for the development of free, open source, peer-reviewed C++ libraries
  Boost plays an influential role in C++ standardization

* Boost offers implementations of many TR1 components but it also offers many other libraries too
