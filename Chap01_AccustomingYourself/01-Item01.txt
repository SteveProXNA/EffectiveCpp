Item 01: View C++ as a federation of languages 


C++ is multiparadigm programming language:
procedural
object-orientated
functional
generic
metaprogramming features


C++ is not a single language;
C++ is a federation of languages


01. C
02. Object-Orientated C++
03. Template C++
04. STL


Pass by value	(C)
More efficient that pass by reference for built-in (C-like) types

Pass by reference to const	(OO, Template)
Better for user-defined objects (with constructors / destructors)
Esp. true for template C++ (you don't know type you're dealing)

Pass by value	(STL)
Better for STL because iterators and function objects are modelled on pointers in C
Iterators and function objects in STL pass by value is better
